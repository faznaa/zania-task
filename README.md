## Frontend Focused

I'm a frontend focused developer, so working on the frontend part as of now. One another reason is I'm more comfortable with nodejs , express than python. 

## Getting Started

Get started by installing the required packages and then starting the server using the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
